<p>
    1. Softly and tenderly Jesus is calling,<br>
    Calling for you and for me;<br>
    See, on the portals He‘s waiting and watching,<br>
    Watching for you and for me.</p>
<p>
    <i>
Come home, come home,<br>
Ye, who are weary, come home;<br>
Earnestly, tenderly, Jesus is calling,<br>
Calling, O sinner, come home!<br>
    </i>
</p>
<p>
2. Why should we tarry when Jesus is pleading?<br>
Pleading for you and for me?<br>
Why should we linger and heed not His mercies,<br>
Mercies for you and for me<br>
</p>
<p>
3. Time is now fleeting, the moments are passing,<br>
Passing from you and from me;<br>
Shadows are gathering, death‘s night is coming,<br>
Coming for you and for me.<br>
</p>
<p>
    4. O for the wonderful love He has promised,<br>
    Promised for you and for me!<br>
    Though we have sinned, He has mercy and pardon,<br>
    Pardon for you and for me.<br>
</p>
