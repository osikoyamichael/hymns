<p>
    1. Praise the King of Glory, He is God alone; <br>
Praise Him for the wonders He to us hath shown; <br>
For His promised presence all the pilgrim way, <br>
For the flaming pillar, and the cloud by day.</p>
<p>
    <i>
        Praise Him, shining angels; Strike your harps of
gold;<br>
All His hosts adore Him, Who His face beholds.<br>
Through His great dominion, while the ages roll, <br>
All His works shall praise Him; bless the Lord, my<br>
soul!
    </i>

<p>
    2. Praise Him for redemption, Free to every soul;<br>
Praise Him for the Fountain that can make us whole; <br>
For His gifts of kindness and His loving care, <br>
For the blest assurance that He answers prayer.<br>
</p>
<p>
    3. Praise Him for thetrials Sent as cords of love;<br>
Binding us more closely to the things above; <br>
For the faith that conquers, hope that naught can
dim, <br>
For the land where loved ones gather unto Him.<br>
