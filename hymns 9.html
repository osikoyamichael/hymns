<p>
    1. Be glad in the Lord, and rejoice,<br>
All ye that are upright in heart;<br>
And ye that have made Him your choice,<br>
Bid sadness and sorrow depart.<br></p>
<p>
   <i>
    Rejoice, rejoice,<br>
Be glad in the Lord and rejoice;<br>
Rejoice, rejoice,<br>
Be glad in the Lord and rejoice<br>
   </i>
</p>
<p>
    2. Be joyful, for He is the Lord,<br>
    On earth and in Heaven supreme;<br>
    He fashions and rules by His word<br>
    The "Mighty" and "Strong" to redeem.<br>
</p>
<p>
    3. What though in the conflict for right<br>
your enemies almost prevail?<br>
God‘s armies, just hid from your sight,<br>
Are more than the foes which assail.
</p>
<p>
    <i>
        Rejoice, rejoice,<br>
    Be glad in the Lord and rejoice;<br>
    Rejoice, rejoice,<br>
    Be glad in the Lord and rejoice<br>
       </i>
</p>
<p>
    4. Though darkness surround you by day,<br>
    Your sky by the night be o‘ercast,<br>
    Let nothing your spirit dismay,<br>
    But trust till the danger is past.
</p>
<p>
    5. Be glad in the Lord, and rejoice,<br>
His praises proclaiming in song;<br>
With harp and with organ and voice<br>
The loud hallelujahs prolong!
</p>
