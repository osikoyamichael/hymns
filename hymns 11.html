<p>
    1. Immortal, invisible, God only wise, <br>
    In light inaccessible hid from our eyes,<br>
    Most blessed, most glorious, the Ancient of days,<br>
    Almighty, victorious, thy great name we praise.</p>
<p>
    2. Unresting, unhasting, and silent as light,<br>
Nor wanting, nor wasting, thou rulest in might;<br>
Thy justice like mountains high soaring above<br>
Thy clouds which are fountains of goodnessand love.
</p>
<p>
    3. To all, life thou givest, to both great and small;<br>
In all life thou livest, the true life of all;<br>
We blossom and flourish as leaves on the tree,<br>
And wither and perish, but naught changeth thee.<br>
</p>
<p>
    4. Thou reignest in glory; thou dwellest in light;<br>
Thine angels adore thee, all veiling their sight;<br>
All laud we would render: Oh, help us to see<br>
'Tis only the splendor of light hideth thee.<br>
</p>
