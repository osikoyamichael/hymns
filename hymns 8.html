<p>1. Praise to the Lord, the Almighty,<br>
    The King of creation!<br>
    O my soul, praise Him,<br>
    For He is thy health and salvation!<br>
    All ye who hear,<br>
    Now to His temple draw near;<br>
    Praise Him in glad adoration.</p>
    <p>
        2. Praise to the Lord, Who over<br>
All things so wondrously reigneth,<br>
Shelters thee under His wings,<br>
Yea, so gently sustaineth!<br>
Hast thou not seen how?<br>
Thy desires ever have been<br>
Granted in what He ordaineth?
    </p>
<p>
    3. Praise to the Lord, Who hath <br>
    Fearfully, wondrously, made thee;<br>
    Health hath vouchsafed and, <br>
    When heedlessly falling,<br>
    Hath stayed thee.<br>
    What need or grief ever hath failed of relief?<br>
    Wings of His mercy did shade thee.
</p>
<p>
    4. Praise to the Lord, Who doth <br>
    Prosper thy work and defend thee;<br>
    Surely His goodness and mercy<br>
    Here daily attend thee.<br>
    Ponder anew what the Almighty can do,<br>
    If with His love He befriends thee.
</p>
<p>
    5. Praise to the Lord, Who, when<br>
    Tempests their warfare are waging,<br>
    Who, when the elements madly <br>
    Around thee are raging,<br>
    Biddeth them cease, <br>
    Turneth their fury to peace,<br>
    Whirlwinds and waters assuaging.<br>
</p>
<p>
    6. Praise to the Lord, Who,<br>
When darkness of sin is abounding,<br>
Who, when the godless do triumph, <br>
All virtue confounding,<br>
Sheddeth His light, <br>
Chaseth the horrors of night,<br>
Saints with His mercy surrounding.
</p>
<p>
    7. Praise to the Lord, <br>
O let all that is in me adores Him!<br>
All that hath life and breath, <br>
Come now with praises before Him.<br>
Let the Amen sound from His people again,<br>
Gladly for aye we adore Him.
</p>
