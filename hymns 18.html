<p>1. Come, ye sinners, poor and needy,<br>
    Weak and wounded, sick and sore;<br>
    Jesus ready stands to save you,<br>
    Full of pity, love, and power;<br>
    He is able, He is able,<br>
    He is willing; doubt no more.<br></p>
    <p>
        2. Now, ye needy, come and welcome;<br>
        God‘s free bounty glorify;<br>
        True belief and true repentance,<br>
        Every grace that brings you nigh;<br>
        Without money, without money,<br>
        Come to Jesus Christ and buy.<br>
    </p>
   <p>
    3. Let not conscience make you linger,<br>
    Nor of fitness fondly dream;<br>
    All the fitness He requireth<br>
    Is to feel your need of Him:<br>
    This He gives you, this He gives you;<br>
    "Tis the Spirit‘s glimmering beam.<br>
   </p>
<p>
    4. Come, ye weary, heavy laden,<br>
    Bruised and mangled by the fall;<br>
    If you tarry till you‘re better,<br>
    You will never come at all;<br>
    Not the righteous, not the righteous;<br>
    Sinners Jesus came to call.<br>
</p>
