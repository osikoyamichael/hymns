<p>1. If you are tired of the load of your sin,<br>
    Let Jesus come into your heart;<br>
    If you desire a new life to begin,<br>
    Let Jesus come into your heart.</p>
<p>
    <i>
Just now, your doubtings give o‘er;<br>
Just now, reject Him no more;<br>
Just now, throw open the door;<br>
Let Jesus come into your heart.
    </i>

2. If it‘s for purity now that you sigh,<br>
Let Jesus come into your heart;<br>
Fountains for cleansing are flowing nearby,<br>
Let Jesus come into your heart.<br>
</p>
<p>
 3. If there‘s a tempest your voice cannot still,<br>
Let Jesus come into your heart;<br>
If there‘s a void this world never can fill,<br>
Let Jesus come into your heart.<br>
</p>
<p>
4. If you would join the glad songs of the blest,<br>
Let Jesus come into your heart;<br>
If you would enter the mansions of rest,<br>
Let Jesus come into your heart.<br>
</p>
