<p>1. Why do you wait, dear brother,<br>
    Oh, why do you tarry so long?<br>
    Your Savior is waiting to give you<br>
    A place in His sanctified throng.</p>
    <p><i>
        Why not? Why not?<br>
Why not come to Him now?<br>
Why not? Why not?<br>
Why not come to Him now?<br>

        2. What do you hope, dear brother,<br>
        To gain by a further delay?<br>
        There‘s no one to save you but Jesus,<br>
        There‘s no other way but His way.<br>
    </p>
<p>
    3. Do you not feel, dear brother?<br>
    His Spirit now striving within?<br>
    Oh, why not accept His salvation,<br>
    And throw off your burden of sin?<br>
</p>
<p>
  4. Why do your wait, dear brother?<br>
    The harvest is passing away,<br>
    Your Savior is longing to bless you,<br>
    There are danger and death in delay.<br>
</p>
