<p>1. Once again the Gospel message<br>
    From the Savior you have heard;<br>
    Will you heed the invitation?<br>
    Will you turn and seek the Lord?</p>
<p>

    Come to Jesus! look and live!<br>
    Come believing! come believing!<br>

    2. Many summers you have wasted,
    Ripened harvests you have seen;
    Winter snows by spring have melted,
    Yet you linger in your sin.
</p>
<p>
3. Jesus for your choice is waiting;<br>
Tarry not: at once decide!<br>
While the Spirit now is striving,<br>
Yield, and seek the Savior‘s side.<br>
</p>
<p>
    4. Cease of fitness to be thinking;<br>
    Do not longer try to feel;<br>
    It is trusting, and not feeling,<br>
    That will give the Spirit‘s seal.<br>

<i>
    Come believing! come believing!<br>
    Come to Jesus! look and live!<br>
    Come believing! come believing!<br>
    Come to Jesus! look and live!<br>
</i>
</p>
<p>
5. Let your will to God be given,<br>
Trust in Christ‘s atoning blood;<br>
Look to Jesus now in Heaven,<br>
Rest on His unchanging Word.<br>
</p>
