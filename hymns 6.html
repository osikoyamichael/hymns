<p>
    1. O for a thousand tongues to sing my great
    Redeemer‘s praise,<br>
    The glories of my God and King, the triumphs of His
    grace!<br></p>
    <p>
        2. My gracious Master and my God, assist me to
proclaim,<br>
To spread thro‘ all the earth abroad the honors of
Thy name.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        3. Jesus! The name that charms our fears, that bids our
        sorrows cease,<br>
        'Tis music in the sinners‘ ears; 'tis life, and health,
        and peace.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        4. He breaks the power of cancelled sin; He sets the
prisoner free;<br>
His blood can make the foulest clean; His blood
availed for me.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        5. Hear him, ye deaf; His praise, ye dumb,<br>
        Your lossened tongues employ, ye build, behold your
        Saviour come;
        And leap, ye lame, for joy!<br>
    </p>
